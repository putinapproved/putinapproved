# Putin Approved - The Offical Putin Approved Stamp**

![Putin Approved Stamp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/putinapproved/putinapproved/master/PutinApproved.png)


I created the Putin Approved stamp to help combat the trend of people on social media re-posting disinformation specifically created to
harm our social discourse, create fear and doubt, and undermining our political process.

Q&A:

Q: How do I use the Putin Approved image?
A: Post it in social media comments in response to propaganda that has no basis in reality. Or if the site you're responding to only supports
text, post a link to this website.

Q: I just saw the Putin Approved stamp in a reply to my social media post. What does it mean?
A: It means the person responding to posted content felt it fits the criteria for untruthful or truth-twisting propaganda. Or they could be
misusing the stamp. If you felt the person using this stamp was in error, provide factual sources to backup your argument.

Q: Isn't this an attack on the [right|left|free speech|etc]
A: Private and nation-sponsored organizations have shown a preference for propaganda that appeals to the far right, but that's not always
the case. They will use anything that manipulates reality to maximize dissent, hatred, and divisiveness on all political sides. Disinformation,
propaganda, and obscuring the truth is the real attack.

Q: So what's the point?
A: Ideally, as the Putin Approved image gains recognition, and as more people use it to call out disinformation, its use will be to
primarily call out disinformation before it gains traction, or at leat to limit the blast radius of the disinformation.
